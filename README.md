This mealplan will fill you up


- REQUIREMENTS:
This project is to build a moderately complex data-driven web site using express.js, node and mongoDB. Your site should require user registration and login and allow users to perform CRUD operations against the data. The server should expose REST data endpoints for all needed data operations, as well as serve the front-end assets (js, html, css).

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:

Your base application should:

- contain a master/detail level category (ex: Locations - master level / Pets - detail level)

- allow access to user accounts (how you choose to implement this is open ended and up to you)

- have the ability to add favorite/wishlist items, which will be tied to the associated user account

- be deployed using Heroku (or something similar)


Your code should:

- be consistent across all files (code style and format)

- be contained in a clean/semantic application structure

- include modularization of primary pieces of functionality

As a group you will need to:

- collaborate cross functionally

- contribute equally

- Sprint 0 basic deployment and infrastructure in place. All teams members can develop and deploy to heroku with appropriate env config.

- create an organization in GitHub, containing all members of your team, travis ci encouraged

- use a consistent branch naming convention (and include relevant feature branches, bug branches, etc)

- ask questions and get help when you're stuck

- create a meaningful and structured README, which will contain

    - coding standards

    - application structure

   - build/test/run instructions

As a bonus, you can:

- add image uploads

- integrate with Travis CI

- add a "Share this" option

- etc, etc, etc

- third party data

- be ultra creative, come up with cool stuff!!!
